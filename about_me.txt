Hi! I am Aduragbemi Oduntan, an independent, resourceful, tech enthusiast who loves to learn and utilize my knowledge to make the world a better place.
Surfing the internet has always been my thing and it was through this I became so keen on knowing the secret behind all the wonderful work of tech I see on the World Wide Web.
The journey so far has been amazing, as I have upgraded from being a total novice in developement to a beginner. My aim is to become a bonafide back-end software engineer and at the long-run a sort after software engineer.
