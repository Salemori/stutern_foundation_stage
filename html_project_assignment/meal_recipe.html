      <h2 id="About">About Pasta</h2>
      <p>
        is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour
        mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then
        cooked by boiling or baking. <br />
        Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in
        place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a
        gluten-free alternative. Pasta is a staple <br />
        food of Italian cuisine.

      <h3 id="Origin">Origin of pasta</h3>
      <p>
        Archaeologists believe that central Asia is most likely the first area
        to have produced noodles thousands of years ago. From Asia, it traveled
        westward. The way it reached Europe <br />
        is unclear, though there are many theoriesÂ—some believe that nomadic
        Arabs are responsible for bringing early forms of pasta westward. Once
        it reached the Mediterranean the <br />
        process was refined, and durum wheat became the ingredient of choice for
        pasta flour because of its high gluten content and long shelf life. When
        durum wheat pasta is dried, it <br />
        lasts indefinitely, making it a very convenient food to store. Over
        time, because of pastas affordability, shelf life, and versatility, it
        became firmly rooted in Italian culture. The <br />
        warm Mediterranean climate of Italy is suited to growing fresh
        vegetables and herbs, which meant that Italians could get creative with
        a delicious variety of pasta sauces. Early <br />
        Spanish settlers were among the first to bring pasta to America. Believe
        it or not, it was Thomas Jefferson that helped give pasta an initial
        push into popularity. During an extended <br />
        stay in Paris from 1784-1789, Jefferson ate what he called macaroni back
        then, the word could have referred to any shape of pasta. He enjoyed the
        dish so much that he returned to <br />
        America with two cases in tow. When his supply ran out, he sent for
        reinforcements via a friend from Naples.

      <h4>Low Sodium ans Cholestrol Free</h4>
      <p>
        If you are watching your cholesterol levels, pasta is perfect for you,
        being very low in sodium and cholesterol free. Per cup, enriched
        varieties of pasta provide a good sources of <br />
        several essential nutrients, including iron and B-vitamins.
      </p>
      <h4>Folic Acid</h4>
      <p>
        Enriched pasta is fortified with folic-acid essential for women of
        child-bearing age. A serving of dry pasta supplies the equivalent of
        roughly 100 micrograms of folic acid, or 25% <br />
        of the recommended daily intake.
      </p>
      <h4>Sustained Energy</h4>
      <p>
        Carbohydrates like pasta provide glucose, the crucial fuel for your
        brain and muscles. And because pasta is an awesome source of complex
        carbohydrates (unlike those of the refined <br />
        and processed variety), releasing energy at a slow and sustained level,
        you do not get the energy spikes associated with simple sugars.
      </p>
      <h4>Balanced Diet</h4>
      <p>
        Pasta is part of a well-balanced diet, with current Australian
        Government guidelines suggesting 35% of our daily calories intake should
        come from complex carbohydrates such as pasta. <br />
        Combine pasta with lean protein and vegetables for a complete meal that
        puts you well on the path to hitting those dietary goals!

        Spaghetti is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. It is a staple food
        of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of
        milled wheat and water and sometimes enriched <br />
        with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from
        durum wheat semolina. Usually the pasta is white because refined flour
        is used, but whole wheat flour may be added. <br />
        Spaghettoni is a thicker form of spaghetti, while capellini is a very
        thin spaghetti. Originally, spaghetti was notably long, but shorter
        lengths gained in popularity during the latter half of <br />
        the 20th century and now it is most commonly available in 25 to 30 cm
        lengths. A variety of pasta dishes are based on it and it is frequently
        served with tomato sauce or meat or vegetables.
